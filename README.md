Get a quick start by checking out the main script `main.py` and read on how to contribute.



Contribute
--------------------------

Before you actually start contributing, create an issue and discuss what you want to do. This is just to avoid that your PR will be denied for some random reason. 

Create your own virtual environment, install the local development environment and run the script. 

```bash
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ alias activate='. .venv/bin/activate'
$ activate
$ make install-tools
$ make test
$ python3 main.py
$ deactivate
```

Check `main.py` for more details (should be moved to pydoc or other proper documentation like here in this README...).



Verify unitttest and code coverage
--------------------------

Run the unittests.

```bash
make unittest
```

Run code coverage and create reports.

```bash
make coverage
```

A html report of the code coverage is generated into `build/coverage/index.html`.



Execute marvin in docker
--------------------------

Start the irc-server [ngircd](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/ngircd) using docker (in its own terminal window).

```bash
docker compose up ngircd
```

Now start the irc-client [irssi](https://hub.docker.com/_/irssi) through docker (or from your desktop) in another terminal.

```bash
docker compose run irssi
```

Use the following commands in your irc-client to connect and join the channel where marvin will be.

```
/connect ngircd
/join #marvin
```

If you are using a client outside of docker, then connect to localhost instead of ngircd.

Then build and start marvin through docker (in a third terminal). 

```
docker compose up marvin
```

Marvin will join your channel and then you can start playing.



API documentation 
--------------------------

The code and API documentation is generated using pdoc and make.

```bash
make pdoc
```

The docs are saved at `docs/pdoc` and can be [viewed online](https://mosbth.github.io/irc2phpbb/pdoc/).



History
--------------------------
The python script, `irc2phpbb.py`, is a implementation of an irc bot. The bot can answer 
simple questions and some more advanced features such as presenting the weather by 
scraping an external website and keeping track of forum posts and posting new posts to 
the channel. The bot is reading incoming entries from a directory and external scripts may 
put information there that should be displayed in the irc-channel.

The PHP-script `aggregate.php` is used to log in to the forum to get credentials to view 
the latest posts through rss. A SQLite database is used to keep track on which posts 
have been displayed in the irc-channel.

The basic code is from: http://osix.net/modules/article/?id=780 and 
http://oreilly.com/pub/h/1968. From there its further developed and customized to fit the target
forum and target irc-channel.

The rfc for the irc protocol is quite helpful: http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/

Customized for dbwebb.se
----------------------------

The bot is created for use in irc://irc.bsnet.se/#db-o-webb which is an irc channel for 
teaching & learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL and Unix. The forum is http://dbwebb.se/forum. 

This means that the code contains some settings to work in that environment and can therefore
not just be cloned and installed. Modifications are needed. The script may anyhow be useful 
as a study object for those in need of similar functionality.


Using feedparser to get RSS-feeds
---------------------------------

The bot uses the `feedparser` python lib to parse RSS feeds, for example when getting the latest post to
the forum. You'll have to download and install the lib yourself.

* http://code.google.com/p/feedparser/


Using BeautifulSoup to scrape web-pages
--------------------------------------

The bot uses the python lib `BeautifulSoup` to scrape information from webpages. Just to show it 
off how it's done but it can of course be made into some useful stuff. 
You'll have to download and install the lib yourself.

Using PHP to keep track on recent posts
---------------------------------------

The file `aggregate.php` uses `magpierss` (http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/) to aggregate feeds from
several places and while discovering new entries it stores messages in the directory `incoming`
where Marvin (the bot) is looking, when finding a file its content will be posted to the 
irc-channel by the bot. You'll have to download and unpack the library in the 'magpierss' folder.
You also need to create the folder 'incoming' and create the database file that will be used. The 
database file should be named db.sqlite and reside in the same folder as aggregate.php. The table 
needed in the database looks like this:

CREATE TABLE aggregate (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, feed text, key text UNIQUE);

Run `aggregate.php` from crontab with regular intervals, for example each 5 minute.

```
*/5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/php /home/mos/git/irc2phpbb/aggregate.php
```
The id of the feed items are stored in a SQLite database to avoid duplicates being posted.
